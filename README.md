Tom's Hangman, 28/09/2024

Thank you for taking a look at my basic code for a hangman game. The files provided should be all that you need to get started with this classic game. The "Pictures" file contains the output for the gallows, the "Words" file contains all the possible words that can be chosen and the "Hangman.py" file should be ready to go for you to play this game yourself. If you wish to add more words, then you should easily be able to do so. Happy playing!
